/*
 * Create an online radio station database.
 * It should keep information about all added songs.
 * On the first line you are going to get the number of songs you are going to try adding.
 * On the next lines you will get the songs to be added in the format
 * <artist name>;<song name>;<minutes:seconds>.
 * To be valid, every song should have an artist name, a song name and length.
 * Design a custom exception hierarchy for invalid songs.
 * Check validity in the order artist name -> song name -> song length.
 * If the song is added, print "Song added.".
 * If you canâ€™t add a song, print an appropriate exception message.
 * On the last two lines print the number of songs added and the total length of the playlist in format
 * {Playlist length: 0h 00m 00s}.
 *
 * Sample input 1:
